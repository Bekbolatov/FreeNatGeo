Bypass (free) registration on National Geographic

This Greasemonkey script will remove the annoying popup on National Geographic articles, that force you to register. It is effective only close to the time of my writing since everything evolves and the site will change.

If a registration popup shows up, click on "Greasemonkey->UserCommand->Remove Forced Registration"

Note: You can also just click "sign in", and then click "exit" without registering.
