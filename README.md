Bypass (free) registration on National Geographic

This Greasemonkey script will remove the annoying popup on National Geographic articles, that force you to register. It is effective only close to the time of my writing since everything evolves and the site will change. Feel free to investigate and modify as necessary.

1. Install Greasemonkey.
2. Install Script.
3. If a registration popup shows up, click on "Greasemonkey->UserCommand->Remove Forced Registration"
4. Enjoy the articles sooner.


Example site - try with and without Greasemonkey script:
